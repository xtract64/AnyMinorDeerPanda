### About Me
I am a beginner programmer who can code in ES (JS), C++, C, HTML, CSS (and SASS), Lua, and Scratch. I love playing games such as Minecraft and Beat Saber and am going start making Beat Saber mods (probably Quest). I am developing a discord bot named Scope with [@The-Brickler](https://github.com/The-Brickler).
